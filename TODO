## CURRENT:

~~- Structure a scope-system that will be passed to the parser to unify statement parsing.~~

How To:

~~- Create a scope struct that will be passed to the parser.~~

~~- When discriminating in the parser the scope is being passed to parsing function~~

~~- Any declaration is allowed in scope (even functions in functions)~~

~~- When a function is declared, a new scope is created and passed to the same parser function for the function body~~

~~- Scope needs to have a parent scope, so that it can be used to resolve declarations from the parent scope~~

```pseudo
fn parse_fn(scope) {
  new_scope = create_scope()
  while ( token != '}' ) {
    parse(new_scope)
  }
}

fn parse (scope) {
  parse_fn(scope)
}
```

- implement expression interpretation to assign values
- create a runtime reporter

## FUTURE:

- Add argument based macros
